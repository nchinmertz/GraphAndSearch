This project builds an unweighted graph from a given file. The first line of the file is the number of verticies in the graph followed by pairs of relations in the graph. The program will display the adjacency matrix and adjacency list of the graph. As well as the breadth first search order starting at 0 and 2 and the depth first search order starting at 3. 

To compile `g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp graph.cpp -o main`

To run `./main tests_files/filename`
